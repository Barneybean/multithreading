#Use of locks https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multithreading-in-python-set-2-synchronization/
# Advantages:
# It doesnâ€™t block the user. This is because threads are independent of each other.
# Better use of system resources is possible since threads execute tasks parallely.
# Enhanced performance on multi-processor machines.
# Multi-threaded servers and interactive GUIs use multithreading exclusively.

# Disadvantages:
# As number of threads increase, complexity increases.
# Synchronization of shared resources (objects, data) is necessary.
# It is difficult to debug, result is sometimes unpredictable.
# Potential deadlocks which leads to starvation, i.e. some threads may not be served with a bad design
# Constructing and synchronizing threads is CPU/memory intensive.

# multithreading
This is a basic example of multithreading in python

Usecases: 
1. When you are extracting data from database with multiple complex SQLs, instead of executing those SQLs one by one, use multithread to execute simultaneously.
2. When you have processes theat needs to execute at different time for different groups but the seond execution might need to start before the first execution complete.
